<h1>International teams to watch out for in the next World Cup</h1>
</body>

<b>In the World Cup it's often the same countries that conquer the competition with it often being rare for lower ranked teams to cause an upset like we seen with Senegal many years ago.</b>
<p></p>
However, over recent times there are some countries which look like they could develop into an elite team ready to create history in the future and cause future upsets to the favourites of the World Cup. Here's some teams we feel you have to give a chance and watch out for in the <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/" target="_blank">2022 World Cup in Qatar.</a>
<p></p>

<h2><span style="color: white">Switzerland</span></h2>
Switzerland are often relaxed when it comes to qualifying for major tournaments in recent times. With the national team qualifying for the last four World Cups along with three of the last four European Championships.

<p></p>
However, Switzerland have never had the players in recent times to compete in these competitions, with the last time they made it to the quarter finals of a world cup being 1954. Switzerland already has a few recognisable names including: Yann Sommer, Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka. But most of the squad, including the more established players, are past their prime and are currently struggling to hold down a first team spot at world class clubs.

<p></p>
Well, it looks like Switzerland's fortunes could change in the future with many promising talents already showing their potential with many of Europe's elites already looking to snatch Switzerland's next talent. 
<p></p>
The main talent being Borussia M&#246;nchengladbach box-to-box midfielder Denis Zakaria. Zakaria has already caught the attention with some of the biggest clubs with Bayern Munich being the latest club added to the list. Zakaria could easily add stability to Switzerland's midfield. Much like Zakaria, it seems that most of Switzerland's talents are found at Borussia M&#246;nchengladbach with fellow Swiss international Breel Embolo and Nico Elvedi also playing for the club.

<p style="text-align: center;">Denis Zakaria</p>

<p>
Perhaps a change in managers could help the team to excel with Swiss manager Lucien Favre now being available after his dismissal from Dortmund.

<h2><span style="color: rgb(247, 127, 0);">Ivory Coast</span></h2>
Despite Africa's intense passion for football, no African country has ever qualified for a final or even a semi-final. With the closest African football has gotten to a semi final was at the 2010 World Cup where Luis Suarez notoriously handballed a goalbound goal which would have sent Ghana to the semi-finals.

<p></p>
It looks like the Ivory Coast have a real chance to make history over the next couple of years with such a young and hungry group of players despite the country's best performance at a World Cup is making the group stage.

<p></p>
The country already has proven players about to enter their primes such as Arsenal most expensive player in history Nicolas P&#233;p&#233; who is starting to find his feet in the Premier League and Manchester United fan favourite Eric Bailly who is one of the Premier Leagues most underrated defenders when he is not injured.

<p></p>
Many of the next set of Ivorian youngsters coming through the ranks and are often found playing in Italy. A key example is AC Milan's Franck Kessi&#233; who has helped the Rossoneri fight for their first title in over ten years. Kessi&#233; is able to play in both attacking and defensive roles. In the Serie A this season he has nine goal contributions along with averaging 1.3 interceptions a game. This versatility will be crucial in a team who often change the way they play against bigger opposition.

<p></p>
Another youngster that was found in Italy is former Atalanta B.C. player Amad Diallo who has now signed for Manchester United. Diallo is a player all Ivory Coast fans want to see, he has been terrorising defenders for the Under-23s showing glimpses of what Ivory Coast and United fans can expect for the first team.

<p></p>
A positive that African countries much like Ivory Coast have unlike European national teams is that many of their best players are dual nationality. There are many French born players who could switch allegiances to Ivory Coast such as Jonathan Bamba, Wesley Fofana and Dan-Axel Zagadou.

<h2><span style="color: red">Czech Republic</h2>
Many football fans today would struggle to name a current world class footballer from the Czech Republic with arguably the last time the country had a world class player was in the 2010's with one of the greatest Premier League goalkeepers and the countries most capped player Petr &#268;ech along with Arsenal fan favourite Tom&#225;&#353; Rosick&#253;. Before then, the only over world class player in modern football would have been former Ballon d'Or winner Pavel Nedv&#283;d.

<p></p>
Things are potentially looking up for Czech Republic with many promising players proving their worth across Europe, many being recognised as some of the best in their respective leagues. One of these players being West Ham's Tom&#225;&#353; Sou&#269;ek who has been regarded as being one of the best midfielders in the Premier league so far this season. Despite being preferred playing as a defensive midfielder, Sou&#269;ek has shown his attacking attributes being the third highest goalscorer midfielder in the Premier league with only midfielders Bruno Fernandes and &#304;lkay G&#252;ndo&#287;an bettering the Czech international.

<p><img title="Tom&#225;&#353; Sou&#269;ek"

<p style="text-align: center;">Tom&#225;&#353; Sou&#269;ek</p>

<p></p>
Another young midfielder who often plays much like Sou&#269;ek is 22-year-old Spartak Moscow midfielder Alex Kr&#225;l. Able to play as a centre back or as a defensive midfielder Kr&#225;l looks like the perfect midfield partner to Sou&#269;ek. So far this season Kr&#225;l has : <ul>
	<li><b><u><i>Four</b></u></i> assists</li>
	<li><b><u><i>81.7%</b></u></i> pass success percentage</li>
	<li>Made <b><u><i>1.3</b></u></i> successful dribbles per match</li>
	<li>Also made <b><u><i>1.7</b></u></i> tackles per match</li>
</ul>


<p></p>
The Czech Republic are starting to build a younger side with hopes for a potential qualification for the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup. But the main problem for the team to figure out is how to create a team with so many defensive minded players while staying competitive.
