<h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>1986 World Cup - Maradonas Hand of God</u></h2>
</p>
<img src ="Graphics/hand of god.jpg" style = "float:left" height="250" width="250"/>
<p>This goal undoubtedly is one of the most iconic yet the most controversial goals ever scored at a Football world cup."The hand of God" was a phrase used by the Argentine footballer Diego Maradona to describe a goal that he scored during the Argentina v England quarter finals match of the 1986 FIFA World Cup. 
    The goal took place on 22 June 1986, at the Estadio Azteca(Aztec Stadium) in Mexico City. 
	Under association football rules, Maradona should have received a yellow card for using his hand and the goal disallowed. 
	However, as the referees did not have a clear view of the play and video assistant referee technology did not yet exist, the goal stood and Argentina led 1 - 0. The game ended with a 2 - 1 win for the Argentines, thanks to a second goal scored by Maradona, known as the "Goal of the Century". 
	After the match, Diego Maradona stated that the goal was scored "a little with his head, and a little with the hand of God".</p>

</p>

<p>Zidane had dragged the French team to the final, scored a penalty in the final and would hang-up his boots after the game.His final act as a professional footballer was to headbutt Materazzi to the ground, after an exchange between the pair.
The former Real Madrid midfielder was sent-off numerous times in his career, but the consensus was that it must have taken something serious to make him lash out in such a way in the biggest, and last, game of his career.
Marco Materazzi later confirmed what he said to zidane to cause such a reaction."My words were stupid but did not deserve that reaction. In any neighbourhood of Rome, Naples,Turin, Milan Paris, I hear much more serious things, "I talked about his sister not his mother" with Zidane being sent off, Italy then went on to win the world cup in what has became one of the most talked about finals in world cup history.</p>

<p>On 27 June 2010, England were playing Germany in the knockout round of the 2010 World Cup in Bloemfontein. In the 38th minute
, 53 seconds after Matthew Upson had scored for England, Frank Lampard shot the ball and it hit the underside of the crossbar,resulting in it crossing
 the line into the goal but bouncing back into the field of play due to backspin (without hitting the net).Neither the referee nor his assistant were in a position
 to award the goal.Had the goal been given, England would have drawn level at 2 - 2. Germany, where this goal was given names like "Wembley goal reloaded", "inverted Wembley goal" 
 or "revenge for Wembley", went on to win the game 4 - 1.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>2010 World Cup - Suarez handball</u></h2>
</p>

<p>In the quarter-final of the 2010 world cup, Ghana had africa on their shoulders as they were the only team left from the continent.
But A handball by Luis Suarez stopped a certain goalbound shot deep into injury time, in one of the most controversial and memorablemoments of that tournament. 
Suarez was sent off - but Ghana missed the resulting spot-kick and, ultimately, went out on penalties after extra time.
The pain for Paintsil and his team-mate Hans Sarpei still lingers. For many Ghanaians, Suarez is the perpetrator of one of the greatest crimes in the country's sporting history.
"We were cheated," Paintsil says.
"He knows what he has done. We were crying and you see someone who has cheated us is celebrating. How can I forgive him? Never. Never ever."
Suarez was quoted in the press saying "the hand of God now belongs to me", referencing Diego Maradona's goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>2014 World Cup - Suarez Bite</u></h2>
</p>
<img src ="Graphics/suarez biter.jpg" style = "float:left" height="250" width="250"/>
<p>Before that tournament Luis Suarez was on a PR campaign. This was a new Luis Su&aacute;rez. Not the one who racially abused Patrice Evra, or bit Ivanovic and Bakkal, or punched Dominic Adiyiah's header off the line against Ghana. "I want to change the bad boy image that has stuck for a bit because 
I don't think I am at all how I have been portrayed," Su&aacute;rez told Sports Illustrated.
But in the first half of Uruguay's final group game against Italy at the 2014 World Cup, Luis Su&aacute;rez launched a late, clumsy challenge on Andrea Pirlo, upending the playmaker with the subtlety of a man taking down a tree with a blunt axe.
Around 40 minutes later,the score still 0 - 0, Su&aacute;rez did similar. But this time the catalyst was something more unusual. Add Giorgio Chiellini's name to the list with Otman Bakkal and Branislav Ivanovic: for the third time in his career, Su&aacute;rez had bitten an opponent during a match.
On 79 minutes, Chiellini half headed away the ball and, as it bobbled out to the left, Su&aacute;rez steamed in. The two jostled, then fell to the floor. 
A livid Chiellini chased Referee Rodr&iacute;guez, pulling aside his shirt to show the teeth marks. In a misguided act,Gaston Ram&iacute;rez attempted to cover the shoulder as if that would make it go away. Su&aacute;rez sat on the floor holding his teeth.
Journalists looked at each other in disbelief: oh my god, he's done it again. The aftermath and backlash Suarez recieved after the game was deserved and was banned for four months.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>2014 World Cup - Brazil 1-7 Germany</u></h2>
</p>
<img src ="Graphics/brazil v germany.png" style = "float:left" height="250" width="250"/>
<p>The Brazil versus Germany football match took place on 8 July 2014 at the Est&aacute;dio Mineir&atilde;o in Belo Horizonte and 
 was the first of two semi-final matches of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.Both Brazil and Germany reached the semi-finals with an undefeated record in the competition, with the Brazilians' quarter-final with Colombia causing them to lose forward Neymar to injury, 
 and defender and captain Thiago Silva to accumulation of yellow cards. Brazil were still expected to go through to the final and win the world cup.
 This match, however, ended in a shocking loss for Brazil; Germany led 5 - 0 at half time, with four goals scored within six minutes,
 and subsequently brought the score up to 7 - 0 in the second half. Brazil scored a consolation goal in the last minute, ending the match 7 - 1.
 The game marked several tournament records. Germany's win marked the largest margin of victory in a FIFA World Cup semi-final.
 The game saw Germany overtake Brazil as the highest scoring team in World Cup tournament history and become the first team to reach eight World Cup Finals. 
 Miroslav Klose scored his 16th career World Cup goal and surpassed Brazil's own Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. Brazil's loss broke their 62-match unbeaten streak at home in competitive matches,going back to the 1975 Copa Am&eacute;rica (where they lost 3 - 1 to Peru),
 equalled their biggest ever margin of defeat in a match alongside a 6 - 0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. Ultimately, the match was described as a national humiliation and the biggest upset in world cup history.</p>
