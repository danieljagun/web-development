<h1>Biggest Upsets of World Cup History</h1>
</body>

Throughout the years of the World Cup we have seen that matches aren't always easily predicted compared to other competitive competitions such as the UEFA Champion League and UEFA Europa League.
<p></p>
We are going to look back at three of the biggest upsets in World Cup history, starting with: 
<p></p>

<p></p>
This was one of the biggest upsets of World Cup history. The game could have gone either way but no one expected the losing team to lose by so much. Brazil hopes of winning a sixth World Cup on home soil was brought to a brutal and humilating end by Germany, who tore through the hosts until the final whistle. Many fans say Brazil's poor performance was due to missing their captain Thiago Silva and star player Neymar Jr.

Another entry from the 2014 tournament, when these two nations had met in the 2010 World Cup final, it was a quite lackluster match ending 1-0 to Spain. Four years later, they encountered again in Group B. This encounter was nothing like the last. Spain scored first with a 27th minute penalty but afterwards everything went downhill for the Spaniards. Netherlands led by Robin Van Persie and  Arjen Robben, both of whom bagged a brace, ran riot in Salvador. The enduring image, of course, is van Persie, repositioning himself to send an unorthodox diving header over Iker Casillas' head.

The French took to the field with most of the side that had lifted the trophy on home soil four years prior. The French were expected to win but it didn't go to plan. Papa Bouba Diop only goal of the games was enough to stun the reigning champions in Seoul. Zinedine Zidane's absence was felt but, even with Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and Robert Pires on the pitch, France were unable to score against Senegal's defence. France were eliminated with just a single point and without managing to score a goal and earned the unwanted record of the worst World Cup performance by World Cup holders. While the Senegalese progressed from the group and made it to the quarter finals where they lost 1-0 to Turkey.
